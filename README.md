# Zenzo Core integration/staging repository


ZENZO(ZNZ) is an open-source privacy focused digital
currency based on Bitcoins blockchain technology, Dash’s Masternodes
and Zerocoin’s Zerocash Protocol, combining them to create a powerful and
innovative technology. ZENZO is also powered by Blackcoin
Proof-of-Stake 3.0 and Bitcoin Core 0.10x code base using Quark
hashing algorithm with a block time of just 60 seconds.

A peer-to-peer digital currency that provides fast, zero cost payments to
anywhere around the world, without any third-party intervention. ZENZO
is a fully decentralized global payment network allowing
individuals to have full control of their finances.

Masternodes require a collateral of 15,000 ZNZ and can be run on the
Tor network for greater privacy. All transactions on the network are fully
verifiable with a built-in blockchain explorer within the software itself. The
reward ratio of staking to masternodes is 35:65.
