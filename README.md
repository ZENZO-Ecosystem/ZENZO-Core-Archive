ZENZO(ZNZ) is an open-source digital
currency based on Bitcoin's blockchain technology, Dash’s Masternodes and 
PIVX’s general Codebase. Each of these elements was combined
to create a powerful and innovative technology. ZENZO is also powered
by Blackcoin Proof-of-Stake 3.0 and Bitcoin Core 0.10x code base, using Xevan
hashing algorithm with a block time of just 60 seconds.

A peer-to-peer digital currency that provides fast, zero cost
payments to anywhere around the world, without any third-party
intervention. ZENZO is a fully decentralized global payment network
allowing individuals to have full control of their finances.

Masternodes require a collateral of 15,000 ZNZ and can be run on the
Tor network for greater privacy. All transactions on the network are fully
verifiable with a built-in blockchain explorer within the software itself. The
block reward ratio of staking to masternodes is 35:65.

The ZENZO(ZNZ) digital currency powers the monetary system behind ZENZO’s many
use cases, such as the [ZENZO Arcade](https://arcade.zenzo.io) and the [ZENZO SDK](https://github.com/ZENZO-Ecosystem/ZENZO-SDK-NodeJS)
